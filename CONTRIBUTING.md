# Contributing to passjen

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project! Your contributions are greatly appreciated and help make this package better for everyone.

Here are a few guidelines to help you get started:

1. **Search for existing issues**: Before creating a new issue, please make sure that it hasn't already been reported. You can search for existing issues by using the search bar at the top of the repository.
2. **Create a new issue**: If you've found a bug or have a suggestion for improvement, please create a new issue using the appropriate template. Provide as much detail as possible, including the steps to reproduce the bug or the desired functionality.
3. **Fork the repository**: Once you've identified an issue you'd like to work on, fork the repository to your own GitHub account. This will allow you to make changes and submit a pull request.
4. **Create a new branch**: Create a new branch in your forked repository to work on your changes. Use a descriptive name that clearly indicates the purpose of your changes.
5. **Make your changes**: Implement your changes in the code. Make sure to follow the existing coding style and conventions.
6. **Write tests**: If applicable, write tests to verify the correctness of your changes. You can use Jest for testing.
7. **Run the tests**: Before submitting your pull request, make sure to run the tests to ensure that your changes haven't introduced any regressions. You can run the tests using the `npm test` command.
8. **Submit a pull request**: Once you've made your changes and tested them, submit a pull request to the main repository. Provide a clear description of your changes and any relevant information.
9. **Address feedback**: If your pull request is reviewed by a project maintainer, they may provide feedback or request changes. Be open to addressing their feedback and making necessary adjustments.
10. **Merge your changes**: Once your pull request has been approved and all feedback has been addressed, it will be merged into the main repository. Congratulations on your contribution!
